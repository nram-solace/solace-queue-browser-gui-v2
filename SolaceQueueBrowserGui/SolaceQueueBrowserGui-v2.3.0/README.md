## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 17 or higher
- Network access to Solace broker SEMP API endpoint
- Network access to Solace broker messaging endpoint
- Appropriate credentials (SEMP admin and messaging client)

### Running the Application

1. **Extract the distribution package** (if you haven't already):
   ```bash
   unzip SolaceQueueBrowserGui-VERSION-runtime-distribution.zip
   cd SolaceQueueBrowserGui-VERSION/
   ```

2. **Configure your broker connection** in `config/default.json` (or create your own config file)

3. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/run.sh -c config/default.json
   ```

For detailed instructions, see the [User Guide](./docs/USER_GUIDE.md).

## Configuration

The application uses JSON configuration files to connect to Solace brokers. A sample configuration file is provided at `config/default.json`. 

**Basic configuration structure:**
```json
{
  "eventBrokers": [
    {
      "name": "My Broker",
      "sempHost": "https://broker.example.com:943/SEMP/v2/config",
      "sempAdminUser": "admin",
      "sempAdminPw": "password",
      "msgVpnName": "default",
      "messagingHost": "tcps://broker.example.com:55443",
      "messagingClientUsername": "client",
      "messagingPw": "password"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Note:** The application requires both SEMP admin credentials (for queue management) and messaging client credentials (for message browsing).

For detailed configuration instructions, see the [User Guide](./docs/USER_GUIDE.md).

## Password Encryption

The application supports encrypted passwords for secure configuration file storage. Use the `crypt-util.sh` script to encrypt passwords:

```bash
./scripts/crypt-util.sh encrypt
```

Encrypted passwords use the format: `ENC:AES256GCM:...`

When encrypted passwords are detected, the application will prompt for a master password (or use `--master-password` command-line option).

For more information, see the [Password Encryption section](./docs/USER_GUIDE.md#password-encryption) in the User Guide.

## Message Operations

### Browse Messages
Select a queue and click "Browse" to open the message browser. Messages are displayed in a paginated table with detailed information.

### Move, Copy, and Delete
- **Move**: Transfers messages from source queue to target queue (removes from source)
- **Copy**: Duplicates messages to target queue (keeps in source)
- **Delete**: Permanently removes messages from queue

Operations can be performed on single messages or multiple selected messages.

### Download Messages
Download selected messages to ZIP files for offline analysis:
- Messages saved to `./downloads/{hostname}/{vpn-name}/{queue-name}/`
- Each message saved as individual ZIP file with payload, headers, and user properties
- Files organized by broker, VPN, and queue for easy management

### Restore Messages
Restore previously downloaded messages back to queues:
- Select target queue and click "Restore"
- Browse to directory containing downloaded message ZIP files
- Select messages to restore (supports bulk selection)
- Messages are republished with original headers and properties preserved
- Can restore to different queues/VPNs/hosts with confirmation

For detailed instructions, see the [Operations section](./docs/USER_GUIDE.md#operations) in the User Guide.
