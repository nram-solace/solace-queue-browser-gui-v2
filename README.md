## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 17 or higher
- Network access to Solace broker SEMP API endpoint
- Network access to Solace broker messaging endpoint
- Appropriate credentials (SEMP admin and messaging client)

### Running the Application

1. **Extract the distribution package** (if you haven't already):
   ```bash
   unzip SolaceQueueBrowserGui-VERSION-runtime-distribution.zip
   cd SolaceQueueBrowserGui-VERSION/
   ```

2. **Create your broker configuration file**:
   - Copy `config/sample-config-plain.json` (or `config/sample-config-encrypted.json`) to `config/default.json`
   - Edit `config/default.json` with your specific broker connection details
   - See `config/sample-config-plain.json` for plain text password example
   - See `config/sample-config-encrypted.json` for encrypted password example

3. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/run.sh -c config/default.json
   ```

For detailed instructions, see the [User Guide](./docs/USER_GUIDE.md).

## Configuration

The application uses JSON configuration files to connect to Solace brokers. Configuration requires:

- **Broker connection details** - SEMP host, messaging host, VPN name, and credentials
- **System configuration** - UI profiles, fonts, colors, and other system settings

**Quick setup:**
1. Copy `config/sample-config-plain.json` (or `config/sample-config-encrypted.json`) to `config/default.json`
2. Edit `config/default.json` with your broker connection details

**Note:** The application requires both SEMP admin credentials (for queue management) and messaging client credentials (for message browsing).

For detailed configuration instructions, file formats, and examples, see the [Configuration section](./docs/USER_GUIDE.md#configuration) in the User Guide.

## Password Encryption

The application supports AES-256-GCM encryption for passwords stored in configuration files. This allows secure storage of credentials in version control or shared configuration files.

- Encrypt passwords using the `crypt-util.sh` utility
- Encrypted passwords use the format: `ENC:AES256GCM:...`
- Master password can be provided via GUI prompt or command-line option

For detailed instructions on encrypting passwords, command-line options, and security considerations, see the [Password Encryption section](./docs/USER_GUIDE.md#password-encryption) in the User Guide.

## Message Operations

The application provides comprehensive message management capabilities:

- **Browse** - Inspect messages with paginated navigation and detailed views
- **Move** - Transfer messages between queues (removes from source)
- **Copy** - Duplicate messages to another queue (keeps in source)
- **Delete** - Remove messages from queues
- **Download** - Save messages to ZIP files for offline analysis
- **Restore** - Republish previously downloaded messages back to queues

Operations support single message or bulk selection. Messages can be filtered by headers, properties, and payload content before operations.

For detailed instructions on performing operations, file formats, and workflow, see the [Operations section](./docs/USER_GUIDE.md#operations) in the User Guide.

## Features in Detail

### Queue Management
Real-time search, filtering by type and category, and sorting capabilities help you quickly find and manage queues across multiple brokers.

### Message Browser
